Maze Game using Core Motion.

The Core Motion framework lets our application receive motion data from device hardware and process that data.

The framework supports accessing both raw and processed accelerometer data using Block object interfaces. For devices with a built-in gyroscope, you can retrieve the raw gyro data as well as processed data reflecting the attitude and rotation rates of the device. You can use both the accelerometer and gyro-based data for games or other apps that use motion as input or as a way to enhance the overall user experience.
